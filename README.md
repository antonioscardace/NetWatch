The project is a health checker. It aims to check in real-time the health of each observed local utility.<br/>
The utility can be a Docker Container, a Machine, or a Network Device in your local network.<br/>
The monitor notifies the utility referent if it changes its state (i.e. **goes offline** or **comes back online**).<br/>
The alert can be a Slack message, an Email, or a Telegram message like these:

This project was created as an exam project to test a set of skills, including:

+ Knowledge of Microservices 
+ Knowledge of Design Patterns
+ Knowledge of Java, Maven, and Spring Boot
+ Knowledge of Messaging Systems (RabbitMQ) and their Patterns
+ Knowledge of Git & GitHub

I also had the opportunity to practice the following skills:
+ Knowledge of ORMs (Hibernate)
+ Knowledge of Redis
+ Use of the Static Analysis Tools (CodeFactor, Snyk Code, and Sonar Qube)

## System Infrastructure

Each microservice is contained in a Docker Container.<br/>
The only reachable containers in the Docker Network are Frontend, API Gateway, and Grafana.<br/>
The UML of the internal structure of each microservice is stored in [/docs/uml/](/docs/uml/)<br/>

Main Notes:

- _RabbitMQ_ provides an Exchange implementing the Publish-Subscribe Design Pattern.
- The HTTP connection between _Monitor_ and _Data Manager_ is a Keep-Alive (persistent) connection.
- _Monitor_ implements the Factory-Method Design Pattern for the _request_ module.
- _Notification_ implements the Factory-Method Design Pattern for the _sender_ module.

## Getting Started

* Get any set of valid credentials or tokens (e.g. for Telegram) to send notifications.
* Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/antonioscardace/NetWatch.git
   $ cd YOUR_PATH/NetWatch/
   $ bash run.sh
```
